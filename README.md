This repository contains Machine Learning algorithms: 

1- SVM

ðŸ§  What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and sometimes regression.

It tries to find the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates classes of data.

It focuses on the support vectors (data points closest to the boundary) to make decisions.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal of SVM (in classification):

To find a line (in 2D) or hyperplane (in higher dimensions) that:

Maximizes the margin (distance between the line and the nearest data points from both classes).

Classifies data points correctly.


2- Linear regression

ðŸ§  What Is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a value based on the relationship between variables.

It tries to find the best-fitting straight line through a set of data points.

ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Linear Regression

When your data has a linear relationship (i.e. as x increases, y increases/decreases at a consistent rate).

When you want to predict numbers (like price, age, temperature).

ðŸ›‘ Limitations

Doesnâ€™t work well if the relationship between variables isnâ€™t linear.

Sensitive to outliers.

Assumes a straight-line relationship, which isnâ€™t always true in real life.

3- Logistic Regression
